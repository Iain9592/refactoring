Task 2.1 Refactoring Steps Completed:

1. Extracted switch statement into getAmount() helper method
2. Renamed local variable thisAmount to result in getAmount() method
3. Renamed parameter p to performance (already done in previous refactoring)
4. Removed Play parameter from getAmount() method (method now only takes Performance)
5. Created getPlay() helper method to retrieve Play from Performance
6. Inlined play variable in statement() method (using getPlay() directly)
7. Removed play parameter from getAmount() using Change Signature refactoring
8. Inlined thisAmount variable in statement() method (calling getAmount() directly)

All refactoring steps completed. Method names updated to match requirements:
- playAmount() -> getAmount()
- playFor() -> getPlay()

Tests should still pass as functionality remains unchanged.
